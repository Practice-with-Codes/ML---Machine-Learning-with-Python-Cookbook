### ✅ Book Reference: *Machine Learning with Python Cookbook* by Chris Albon

This book is an excellent practical guide for anyone learning or working with **machine learning using Python**.  
It provides **hundreds of hands-on recipes** that demonstrate how to perform common tasks in data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment.  

Each recipe is **concise and solution-focused**, showing how to apply popular libraries such as **NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and Matplotlib**.  

It’s particularly useful for **students, data enthusiasts, and professionals** who want to quickly find code examples for real-world ML problems.  

✅ **Key Highlights**
- Covers data cleaning, feature engineering, and model selection.  
- Includes ready-to-use Python snippets for practical implementation.  
- Explains core ML concepts with clear and reproducible examples.  

This book serves as a **handy reference and coding companion** throughout your machine learning journey.

A practical reference based on *Machine Learning with Python Cookbook* by Chris Albon — featuring clear, ready-to-use Python recipes for data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation using libraries like NumPy, pandas, and scikit-learn.
